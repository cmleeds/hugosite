## Hello!
  
  Welcome to my personal website. I built this website as a way to participate and collaborate in the data science community. This site is being rendered with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 
  
  If you have any questions, then please feel free to [contact me](mailto:chris@christopherleeds.com).

## Coming Soon

  I will be adding posts with analytic work soon. I intend for all work to be done with R since this will be easiest way to add analytic samples within the rmarkdown framework. 
  
  Python samples may be added in time as a expand my python skillset along with some front-end web development.
