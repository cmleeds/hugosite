## Hello!

Welcome to my personal website. I built this space as a way to participate and collaborate in the data science community. This site is being rendered with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo is a great tool to generate static websites quickly.

If you have any questions, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:chris@christopherleeds.com).

## What you'll find

Data science is a very broad space and it can be difficult to assess where an individual's strengths lie. Each tool in your toolkit (e.g. git, R, python, plotly, shiny, dash, domino, jenkins, etc.) can become a universe unto itself. So, it becomes important to ask what **you** can do with these tools.

What can **you** do with R? How can **you** deploy python apps/modules? These questions are ultimately more meaningful. And by making this site, I hope to answer that for myself, and encourage others to do the same.

## What is data science?

> "A data scientist is someone who knows more statistics than a computer scientist and more computer science than a statistician."

Data science is a large space with people of exceedingly disparate backgrounds. The *Data Science Venn Diagram* is the most common answer one might here to the question: what is a data science?

Quite often, I come across individuals who identify as data scientists who have built entirely different workflows on entirely different objectives. My own journey has taken me from a primarily SAS based workflow with classical statistical models and analysis to a workflow based in R with an emphasis on cloud computing tools to automate data wrangling & analysis.
