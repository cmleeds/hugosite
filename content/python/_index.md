## Introduction

This series of posts will seeks to make show data wrangling, visualization, and analysis with [python](https://www.python.org/). I am fairly new to the python programming language and workflow and I look forward to sharing my journey as climb the 'learning curve'.

On OSX, I have a [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installation of python3 without disturbing our original python 2.7 distribution needed for local apps. My primary workflow will rely on [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) so I can organize my code and thoughts.
