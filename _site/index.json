	"content": "  Background I was born and raised in a small community in Illinois. After high school, I attended Truman State University starting in the fall of 2008, shortly after the housing bubble burst. I quickly developed an interest in economics \u0026amp; finance which led me to complete my BS in economics in 2012.\nAs completion of my undergraduate degree neared, I learned that my skillset was lacking the technical expertise required for adequate consideration in the job market. So, I applied and was accepted to the University of Missouri graduate program in statistics where I would pursue my MA.\nIn Columbia, I developed a strong interest in programming and analytics. The MA statistics program gave me the opportunity to begin developing a much needed technical skillset while teaching a few courses a year.\nUpon graduation, I was able to leverage this newfound interest into a career in research and development. I\u0026rsquo;m always looking to meet and work with motivated and curious individuals.\n Philosophy  Evolve \u0026amp; adapt, be a self-driven \u0026amp; life-long learner. Break down complex problems into their simplest components.\n Deploy rapidly, get feedback faster. Document, document, document!    Skills I practice data science in the biotech \u0026amp; agriculture space. I love what I do and am always looking to grow.\nPlease view my resume for more details.\n"
